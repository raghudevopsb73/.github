### Github Discussion:
During the practice of the topics we expect to have some problems and hoping you will be solving them by
  - watching the video again to find what you have missed
  - delete the things you have done and start from scratch again for couple of times
Still if you have done those things and still you need some help around it then you can create a discussion with trainer. Following is the link to create a discussions.

Also you can learn a lot many things from other problems, So I would suggest you to spend some time on discussions posted by other students and learn from there as well. Following link will have all the discussions created by all the students.
